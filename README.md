# Low level PSX

Ps1 programming without a SDK.

Much inspired and taken from:

    https://github.com/PeterLemon/PSX
    https://github.com/iamgreaser/psx-chain
    https://github.com/ARM9/psxdev

At the moment the makefile assumes you have Lameguy 64's PSN00bSDK
(for the linker script and libC)

The `raw_asm` directory contains a program to fill the screen white in main.asm
TODO - c_test directory
